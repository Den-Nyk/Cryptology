Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have significantly contributed to the increase of greenhouse gases, resulting in the warming of the earth's surface. This warming has caused sea levels to rise, more frequent extreme weather events, and shifts in the timing of seasons.

Climate change has wide-ranging effects on both natural and human systems. It can cause devastating effects on ecosystems, including extinction of plant and animal species, loss of biodiversity, and alterations in ecosystem services. Human impacts include increased mortality and morbidity from heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms, as well as disruptions to food and water supplies.

To mitigate the effects of climate change, many countries and organizations are taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and shift towards renewable energy sources. This involves implementing policies such as carbon taxes, promoting public transportation and electric vehicles, and investing in clean energy technologies. In addition, individuals can take action by reducing their own carbon footprint through practices such as conserving energy, reducing waste, and choosing environmentally friendly products.

Despite efforts to address climate change, it remains a pressing issue that requires continued attention and action. Urgent action is needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change and ensure a sustainable future for both people and the planet.
